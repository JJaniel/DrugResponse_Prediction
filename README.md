This code focuses on a pharmacogenomics study that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to investigate the factors influencing drug response in cancer cell lines. Specifically, aiming to understand how a patient's genomic profile and protein expression levels influence their response to the drug BMS-536924 and BMS-754807 drug.
The XAI model has pinpointed key proteins that appear to significantly impact drug response:
YAP_pS127_Caution (likely phosphorylated YAP): Lower levels of this protein correlate with a negative response to the drug.
Xanthine and Tyrosine: Higher levels of these compounds seem to be associated with better drug effectiveness.
These findings offer valuable insights for precision medicine. By understanding these influential features, researchers can potentially predict which patients will benefit most from BMS-536924 treatment.  This knowledge can help tailor drug selection and potentially improve patient outcomes in cancer therapy.
